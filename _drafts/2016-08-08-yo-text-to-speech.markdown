Yo, is a service that listens to commands.

This may be focused for old people who suffer disabilities, like my grandmother
use to suffer.


## Architecture

How to implement a local speech detection to avoid sending commands to external
apis every time?

Text-to-Speech first, then, human-like speech interaction.

Add I/O to this, we can plug in external hardware that connects to this.

How pratai can be used here?
