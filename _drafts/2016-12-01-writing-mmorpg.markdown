This is the first part of a series of posts about writing a MMORPG game.

  * [The basics]({{site.baseurl}}/mmorpg/2016/12/01/writing-mmorpg.html) - you are here.

## Motivation
Writing a videogame is hard. Before I started I had to ask myself why should I write a video game instead of just playing one. 
And a couple of answers came into my mind:

* Learning new development stacks.
* Improve my development and management skills.
* This is a good challenge.
* And most important, just for the lolz.

But there was something missing, and for that matter, something quite important. What's the motivation behind the game?
