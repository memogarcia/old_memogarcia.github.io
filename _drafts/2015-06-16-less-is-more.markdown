do you really need trello, wunderlist, evernote, and all those tools?
why not use them as a database of stuff you like but indexed? how to sync it accross devices?


use a minimalistic todo list
archive done stuff, focus on what's next, not in what's done.
have a mind dump place, where you can write what's on your mind without format or rules
in your spare time, create playlists
pomodoro?
use a single fucking tool for the same job but don't be afraid to try new stuff
don't reinvent the wheel
use news aggregators
hide everything
